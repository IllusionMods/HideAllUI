# HideAllUI
A plugin for games made by Illusion that allows you to hide game interface with a press of a button. Works in studio, maker and H scenes. Useful for taking a good look at things and for recording the game window with something like OBS. Currently has versions for PlayHome, Koikatsu, AI-Shoujo and HoneySelect2.

## How to install
1. Install at least [BepInEx 5.0](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases).
2. Download the latest [release](../../releases) for your game.
3. Extract the version for your game inside your game directory.
4. Try starting Studio or maker and pressing Space to hide the interface.
